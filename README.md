Complex_Equation_Plotting_Now_With_Phase_Variance_Thanks_To_Arcane_Algorithm_Archive Hey !! Back again with some further developped goodies! As i also pointed out on the code comments, i give a good share of credits, reconaissance and praise to the Arcane Algorithm Archive Wizzards :D, the website i linked to in my comments will show you how they broadened yet again, my understanding of  "Angular Phase" in resulting complex conjugate meshgrids from playing around modeling these equations. from on a random side-note: "effective-octo-pancake" was a remarkably wierd suggestion for this repository's name lmao
